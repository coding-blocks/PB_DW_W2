#heapq by default makes use of min heap concept. heapify builds heap, heappop pops smallest element from heap, heappush(a,4) pushes 4 in heap.
#For making use of max heap simply multiply all the elements with -1 and then use min heap concept and then change the sign of the value as an when required.
