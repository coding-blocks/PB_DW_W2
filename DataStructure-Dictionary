#The dictionary is basically key and value pair in python.
a={1:"India",2:"Australia",3:"USA"}
#Here in a 1,2,3 are key while India,Australia and USA are values.
print(a[1]) #Prints India
#The key must be unique while values may even contain a list of other values.
#Ex:
a={1:["India","Australia","USA"],2:["Pakistan","Spain","Italy"]
print(a[1][2])#Prints USA
#The datatype of key and value can be anything as long as key is unique.
